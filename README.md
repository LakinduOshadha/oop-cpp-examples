OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or functions that perform operations on the data, while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and functions.

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

OOP is faster and easier to execute
OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

--- Examples ---

1. Write a class declaration section named Circle and include a member function named 
getArea() that can be used to calculate the area of a circle. Comprise the declaration in a 
complete working program. You may use pi = 3.14. 

2. Write a program to define a class named Circle and include two data members: radius(of type 
double) and color (of type String); and three member functions: getRadius(), getColor(), and 
getArea() as getters. Also create a constructor with default values for data members (radius = 
1.0 and color = “red”). 
Create three instances of Circle called c1, c2, and c3 shall then be constructed with their 
respective data members inside the main(), as shown in the instance diagrams. 
Instances <see Examples.pdf>

3. Write a program to print the sum, difference and product of two complex numbers by 
creating a class named 'Complex' with member functions for each operation whose real and 
imaginary parts are entered by the user
